## Description


All data, results and code related to the [paper](biorxiv) can be found herewithin. For results that represent as large sets of images or tables, we provide scripts that are self-contained within this repository (i.e., all you need to do is to run them to reproduce our images) that allow you to reproduce these.

We have compiled a `shiny` app that allows you to explore the data and results interactively from your own browser, to see how you deploy and orient this tool go to the section "[Shiny App](#shiny-app)" below.

## Data access
A lot of people have inquired about access to the data used in this manuscript,
all data is accessible at
[this](https://zenodo.org/record/3957257#.Y4LB-rLMIfg) Zenodo repository. **However**, the
data is _encrypted_ using [7z](https://7-zip.org/7z.html). To decrypt these files, use
the following passwords:

* count matrices and images: `zNLXkYk3Q9znUseS`
* meta data and spot selection: `yUx44SzG6NdB32gY`

For further questions, please see contact details  below.

    * `* spw-enr.py` : calculates spot-wise enrichment of gene set using Fisher's exact test (Figure 4)
    * `* rank-plot.py` : generates a rank-plot where genes to highlight can be provided by a text file or as an argument.

    * `* viz-tls-score.py` : visualized, B-cell and T-cell proportions together with calculated TLS-score
    * `* tls.py` :  fits the TLS-model. Takes as input a set of count matices and associated proportion values for these. 
    * `* fea.py` :  conduct functional enrichment analysis using g:Profiler for a set of provided genes. Generates tsv file with all pathways and an image. (Figure 5)
    * `* predict.py` : predict TLS-score for a ST/Visium section. Takes count data for the section to apply the model to and a coefficient file (generated by tls.py)
    * `* proportion-highlight.py`: plots proportion estimates with specific regions highlighted. Uses a design-file to customize the character of the plot (see `figure3-config.yaml` below). Used to generate Figure subplots 3A and 3B.

* `app/`
    * `data/` : pre-processed count matrices, cell type proportion tables and images used for shiny application

`*` := with CLI (command line interface). Do ```./script.py -h``` to see the different options that can be used.

## Shiny App 

While all the data and results are available as raw files, we have also constructed a tool that allows you to **interactively explore** these. The tool will open up in your default browser, but it runs locally (i.e. you host all the files on your own computer). See below for instructions regarding how to setup and orient the tool.


### Setup

Begin by cloning this repository; to do so open a terminal, then enter a directory where you'd like to clone the repository into (here `MY_DIR`) and then do:

```sh
cd MY_DIR
git clone https://github.com/almaan/her2st.git .
```

Next, we'll make sure that all the necessary packages (e.g., `shiny`) are installed. We've prepared an installation script for you - this will not overwrite you current package versions - that should take care of everything. However, if you're missing some dependencies (C++ backends) you might have to do a manual install. To check for and install missing packages; from the folder that you cloned this repo into, do:

```sh
cd her2st/app
./install-packages.R

```

_NOTE_ : Make sure `install-packages.R` have the proper permissions (e.g., by doing `chmod +x install-packages.R` on a Linux computer) before running it.

If everything went as expected you should see a message like:

```sh

----
Successful installs:
----
ggplot2
jpeg
Matrix
grid
magrittr
magick
zeallot
shiny
shinyWidgets
shinycssloaders
shinydashboard
RColorBrewer
viridis
dplyr
extrafont

----
Failed installs:
----
NONE

```

In case you have any failed installs, try to install these manually and troubleshoot what dependencies you might be missing. 

Once all the packages are installed - we are ready to run the app!

### Usage 

To launch the app, do:

```sh
cd MY_DIR/her2st/app
./launch.R
```
_NOTE_ : Just as for `install-packages.R` make sure `launch.R` have the proper permissions before running it.

This should open a new tab or browser-window, with an address like `127.0.0.1:XXXX` looking like:

<br>

As you can see you have some different options to choose from (indicated with dashed red boxes and a number). To elaborate some regarding these:

1. **Select section** - click on the patient you want to visualize a section from, a drop-down menu will appear listing the different sections you can choose from.
2. **Gene** - Select a gene of interest (GOI) to visualize the spatial expression of, overlaid on the tissue. You can either type the name your GOI or click the arrow to prompt a drop-down menu of genes to select from.
3. **Cell type** -  Select a tier and cell type (from a drop-down menu) to visualize the spatial distribution of this type (the proportion estimates) overlaid on the tissue.
4. **Opacity** - Allows you to set the transparency of the markers
5. **Colors** - Allows you to set the colormap used to visualize the values (default is Green)
6. **Edgecolor** - Toggle whether edgecolor should be on or off

_NOTE_: Only one of the features in 2 and 3 can be visualized at a time, the last one selected will be displayed.
